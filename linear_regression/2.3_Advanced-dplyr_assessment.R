# 5) You want to take the tibble dat, which we used in the video on the advanced dplyr, and run the linear model R ~ BB for each strata of HR. 
# Then you want to add three new columns to your grouped tibble: the coefficient, standard error, and p-value for the BB term in the model.
# Youâ€™ve already written the function get_slope(), shown below.
get_slope <- function(data) {
  fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
  sum.fit <- summary(fit)
  
  data.frame(slope = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Estimate"], 
             se = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Std. Error"],
             pvalue = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Pr(>|t|)"])
}

# As a reminder, the tibble dat is defined as follows:
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR = round(HR/G, 1), 
         BB = BB/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  select(HR, BB, R) %>%
  filter(HR >= 0.4 & HR<=1.2)

# What additional code could you write to accomplish your goal?
dat %>% 
  group_by(HR) %>% 
  summarize(get_slope(across()))


# 7) You want to know whether the relationship between home runs and runs per game varies by baseball league. You create the following dataset:
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR = HR/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  select(lgID, HR, BB, R)

# What code would help you quickly answer this question?
dat %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  summarize(tidy(lm(R ~ HR, data = across()), conf.int = T)) %>% 
  filter(term == "HR")

# This code is a good application of the command tidy(), from the broom package.
# The glance() function provides data on model fit rather than on effect estimates and confidence intervals. If you forget the line group_by(lgID), your code will give you a single estimate for the entire dataset because you have not grouped the data by league ID.

## All

# When considering the estimates, which of the following statements are true?
## All of the confidence intervals overlap each other.
## The confidence intervals involving mothers' heights are larger than the confidence intervals involving fathers' heights.
## The data are consistent with inheritance of height being independent of the child's gender.
## The data are consistent with inheritance of height being independent of the parent's gender.


# The std.error values are lower for daughters than sons, resulting in smaller confidence intervals
# To instead compare the effect of parent's gender, for example, we would want to compare the ESTIMATES for father-daughter vs mother-daughter (as well as father-son vs mother-son). If they are very different, this will suggest there is a difference by gender.
